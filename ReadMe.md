**Student Mental Health · Measurement Theory App**

A React-based dashboard for tracking student mental wellbeing, grounded in formal measurement theory. Every metric in mindflow is explicitly typed to its measurement scale — Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio, or Absolute — ensuring that only statistically valid operations are performed on each data type.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Dashboard
Real-time overview of all wellness metrics with scale types displayed inline:

- **Current Streak** — Ratio scale. True zero exists; multiplicative comparisons are valid (14 days = 2× 7 days).
- **Total Logins** — Absolute scale. Direct count with no arbitrary unit.
- **Journals Completed** — Absolute scale. Each check-in increments by exactly 1.
- **7-Day Mood Sparkline** — Ordinal scale. Order is preserved; numeric distances are not meaningful.
- **Resource View Counts** — Ratio scale. True zero; arithmetic fully valid.

### 😊 Daily Vibe Check-In (`/vibe`)
Log your emotional state using a formal empirical-to-numeric mapping:

| Emoji | Label    | φ(mood) | Scale   |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| 😢    | Terrible | 1       | Ordinal |
| 😞    | Down     | 2       | Ordinal |
| 😐    | Neutral  | 3       | Ordinal |
| 🙂    | Good     | 4       | Ordinal |
| 😄    | Great    | 5       | Ordinal |

Each submission runs a **homomorphism validation** — verifying that the label-to-value mapping is consistent with the formal relational system before saving.

### 💬 Support Circle Forum (`/forum`)
Anonymous peer-support posts categorized by topic using a **Nominal scale**:

`Anxiety` · `Depression` · `Stress` · `Burnout` · `Study Tips` · `Relationships` · `General Wellness`

Categories carry no inherent ordering — "Anxiety" is not greater or lesser than "Stress"; they are simply distinct classes.

### 📈 Health Score (`/scores`)
An **indirect composite measurement** derived from four direct inputs:

```
Health Score = (0.40 × streak) + (0.35 × avg vibe) + (0.15 × logins) + (0.10 × check-ins)
```

All inputs are normalized to [0, 100] before combination. The result is an **Interval scale** — zero does not mean "no health"; it is an arbitrary lower bound.

Scores map to engagement tiers (Ordinal):

| Tier      | Range    |
|-----------|----------|
| Low       | 0 – 25   |
| Moderate  | 26 – 50  |
| High      | 51 – 75  |
| Excellent | 76 – 100 |

## 🗂️ Measurement Theory Reference

| Scale    | Where Used                          | Valid Operations                          |
|----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Nominal  | Support Circle categories           | Equality / inequality only                |
| Ordinal  | Daily Vibe (1–5), Engagement Tiers  | Order comparisons (`<`, `>`)              |
| Interval | Health Score composite              | Addition, subtraction; ratios invalid     |
| Ratio    | Streak days, resource view counts   | All arithmetic including × and ÷          |
| Absolute | Login count, journal count          | All arithmetic; unique natural unit       |

## 📏 Software Size Metrics (`software-size.js`)

The project includes `software-size.js` at the workspace root to compute length-based size metrics for JavaScript and JSX source files.

### What It Measures

- `LOC` (Lines of Code): all lines in each file.
- `NCLOC` (Non-Comment Lines of Code): non-empty lines that are not comments.
- `CLOC` (Comment Lines of Code): lines that begin with `//`, `/*`, or `*`.
- `Comment Density`: `(Total CLOC / Total LOC) * 100`.

### How It Finds Source Files

The script auto-detects your source directory in this order:

1. `my-app/src`
2. `src`

This supports the current workspace layout where the React app lives in `my-app/`.

### Run Command

From `my-app/`, run:

```bash
npm run software-size
```

If PowerShell blocks `npm` via execution policy, use:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" run software-size
```

### Latest Results

Measured output from the current codebase:

```text
src/App.jsx: LOC=527, NCLOC=472, CLOC=11
src/main.jsx: LOC=11, NCLOC=9, CLOC=0

=== Project Metrics Summary ===
Total LOC: 538
Total NCLOC: 481
Total CLOC: 11
Comment Density: 2.04%
```

## 🧪 Validation Logic

The `validateCheckIn` function enforces formal measurement consistency:

```js
validateCheckIn({ moodValue: 4, moodLabel: "Good" })
// → { valid: true, error: null }

validateCheckIn({ moodValue: 3, moodLabel: "Great" })
// → { valid: false, error: 'Homomorphism violation: "Great" should map to 5, got 3' }
```

This ensures the empirical relational system (emotional states) and the formal numeric system (1–5) remain consistent, preserving the integrity of all downstream analyses.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (hooks-based, no external state library)
- **Inline styles** (no CSS framework dependency)
- **SVG** for sparklines and circular progress indicators
- **Vanilla JS** for measurement calculations

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. When adding new metrics, please document:
1. The **scale type** (Nominal / Ordinal / Interval / Ratio / Absolute)
2. Whether it is **direct** or **indirect** measurement
3. Which **arithmetic operations** are valid on the metric

This keeps mindflow's measurement-theoretic foundation intact.
